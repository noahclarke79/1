THOUGHTS ON THE FIELD OF COMPUTING  
a very instering field, with technical elements that can be a struggle to get a grasp of. 
**numbers.symbols.abreveations.dots.codes**
relating computinig to design is talked about as the future by some 
(contray to what Maureen at the market said, she thinks graphic design is going back the print and physiccal prosesses, which was intersting to hear) 
as a desginer of some sort i think _the field of computing_ is a daunting but important space for moving forward. 
i struggle loosing the tactilty of my work when using computing but harmonzing the two is exciting
and the juxstapostion of both worlds compliment each other in a unique way.

The greens. The compact elements of them. 
I might not know what things are or what they do (yet), but I like the way they look. This for me is sometimes the start of getting to know a topic and my interest can grow from that into something more in depth and from this I can apply it to design and create stuff . 
Like these linos. 
The colours.
The lines.
The shapes. 
Visually the different electrical components isolate themselves into groups of layers and textures and I wanted to enhance that by stacking various colours over colours. 
Like a city photographed from above, embroidered with metal soldering to bind wires and the silk layer with the copper layers.

These images of lino prints represent how I approached a brand new area of working. Stripping it back to the basics and analysing what I can see. 
using methods I am familiar with helped push this work forward, while still being cohesive with the new content I was learning. 
discovering how PCBs work and what they are made helped me visualize what I wanted to do with my prints. 
Layering each print over each other to mimic how the layers on the PCB from the kit we received on monday. Starting with fibreglass and copper layers sandwiched together with an etched with photoresist and acid reductions, to create the pathways that carry information and instructions across the board.
