thoughts on the field of computing 
a very instering field, with technical elements that can be a struggle to get a grasp of.

relating computinig to design is talke dabput as the future by some 
(contray to what Maureen at the market said, she thinks graphic design is goong back the print and physiccal prosesses, which was intersting to hear) 
as a desginer of some sort i think _the field of computing_ is a daunting but important space for moving forward. 
i struggle loosing the tactilty of my work when using computing but harmonzing the two is exciting
and the juxstapostion of both worlds compliment each other in a unique way.

The greens. The compact elements of them. 
I might not know what things are or what they do (yet), but I like the way they look. This for me is sometimes the start of getting to know a topic and my interest can grow from that into something more in depth and from this I can apply it to design and create stuff . 
Like these linos. 
The colours.
The lines.
The shapes. 
Visually the different electrical components isolate themselves into groups of layers and textures and I wanted to enhance that by stacking various colours over colours. 
Like a city photographed from above, embroidered with metal soldering to bind wires and the silk layer with the copper layers.
